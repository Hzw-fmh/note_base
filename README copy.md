# HZW_NOTE_BASE
## It stores all the notes and some previous information files I made or collected when in ZJU

The reason why I start to updating my note:

    I've found that the knowledge system in university is vast and complex. 
    It's impossible to fully internalize everything through lectures alone, which makes note-taking particularly crucial! 
    Personalized notes can effectively condense scattered knowledge points into tailored key takeaways, 
    significantly boosting review efficiency. 
    Moreover, well-structured notes create easy access for future reference, 
    allowing you to quickly revisit previously overlooked concepts and connections.
    I believe that my learning efficiency and quality can be enhanced through organizing notes！！！
